      Cats were first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Near East. They are now the second most popular pet in the United States, with many breeds and care practices. Proper nutrition, grooming, and veterinary care help keep your cat healthy and happy.

      <h2>0 – 4 Weeks</h2>
      <p>
        Newborn kittens should nurse from the queen (mother cat) and stay with her. Monitor growth and weight gain. If a kitten is not gaining appropriately, intervention may be needed. Reasons a kitten might not gain weight include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
        <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
        <li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>4 Weeks – 1 Year</h2>
      <p>
        Around 3–4 weeks, introduce soft wet kitten food. Feed 0.5–1 cup of dry food or 6–9 oz of wet food per day, split into meals. See the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> for more. Add water to dry food if needed. Prefer kitten-formulated food and check with your vet for your cat’s specific needs.

      <h2>1 Year – 7 Years</h2>
      <p>
        At this age, when kittens are no longer kittens and have reached the <em>cat stage</em>, they do not need as many nutrients. Their level of activity and metabolism decrease. It is recommended that you <strong>NOT</strong> leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snack throughout the day. This helps reduce the risk of obesity and other weight-related ailments.
      </p>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>7 Years +</h2>
      <p>
        As with many living organisms, the cat’s body begins to change with age. Older cats should be fed fewer fats and calories and more quality protein. When buying packaged food, look for a named protein (e.g. “salmon”) and <strong>NOT</strong> just a category (e.g. “fish”). The latter often means byproducts or lower-quality protein combinations.
