      The domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture. Today, dogs are a source of companionship, reduced loneliness, <a href="#">reduced blood pressure</a>, and <a href="#">improved lipid profiles</a>. Caring for a dog can be rewarding, but it also requires attention to feeding, exercise, and health.

      <h2>Diet & Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout their lives, dogs should be fed a diet that is appropriate for their age and size. Young dogs need to be nursed for the first two months of life, then weaned onto solid food. From 3–6 months, feed three meals per day. From 6–12 months, feed two meals per day. After one year, one meal per day is typically sufficient. Dogs are 60–70% water, so ensure they have access to fresh water at all times. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> says that a 10–15% decrease in body water can cause serious illness; a 25% loss can be fatal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activity and exercise are important for healthy blood flow, heart, and organs. Most dogs need 30–120 minutes of exercise per day, depending on breed and size. That doesn’t mean a push-up contest—brisk walks and play are enough. Regular activity also helps prevent obesity and boredom-related behaviors.

      <h2>Grooming & Handling</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping your furry family member clean is important for health. Brush frequently to reduce shedding, and check for ticks and fleas. When bathing your dog, rinse thoroughly so no soap remains that could cause rash or matted fur. Handle dogs gently—support under the chest and front legs when lifting small dogs; for large dogs, reach under the belly with both arms perpendicular to the dog, and support the chest and rear.

      <h2>Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
      <p>
        Always consult your veterinarian. A core set of vaccines is usually recommended (e.g. rabies, distemper, parvovirus). These reduce the risk of exposure to hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Other vaccines may be recommended based on environment and lifestyle, such as those for <a href="#">Bordetella bronchiseptica</a>, <a href="#">Borrelia burgdorferi</a>, and <a href="#">Leptospira bacteria</a>.
